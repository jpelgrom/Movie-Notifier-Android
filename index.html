                <h3>Movie Notifier privacy information</h3>
                <p><b>What information is collected?</b><br/>If you create an account we collect a username and password, and if enabled a unique device identifier for push notifications and/or an email address. If automagic sorting or sorting cinemas by distance is enabled, we also collect location data.</p>
                <p><b>How is your data used?</b><br/>The collected data is only used to allow you to use Movie Notifier and provide the advertised features.</p>
                <p><b>Sharing with third parties</b><br/>When sending you a notification, we need to share some data with the third party that delivers the notification for it to work. Push notifications are sent using <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> and emails are sent using <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/privacy-policy">Mailgun</a>.<br/>A unique device identifier for push notifications is registered with Firebase when opening the app, but is not sent to Movie Notifier if no account is registered. Your email address is only shared when delivering a notification - if we don't have a notification, it isn't shared.<br/>Any other data is not shared with third parties at all.</p>
                <p><b>Updating and deleting your information</b><br/>You can update or delete your account at any time in the app. Changes are immediately processed.</p>
                <p><b>How can I stop data collection?</b><br/>You can turn off push notifications and notifications via email at any time in the app. After doing so, this personal data is no longer stored in your account. Location access can be disabled in the app and system settings. Your username and password is required to allow you to use Movie Notifier, and can only be deleted by deleting your account.</p>
                <p><b>How long is data stored?</b><br/>Location data is only stored locally and immediately discarded after use. Other data is linked to your account, which can be deleted at any time.</p>
